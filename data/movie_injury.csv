He was ready to bail out and called back to his mechanic Phil Jones (who was in the rear of the plane dumping lampblack to simulate smoke) to jump, but Jones didn't hear him and went down with the plane. Only one brief shot of the spinning Sikorsky was used in the film.[24][25] Two other stunt pilots, Al Johnson and Clement Phillips, were killed in separate accidents.

Filming in the unsanitary conditions while not yet fully recovered led to Colbert being hospitalized with a severe fever two days later."
The Lost Patrol ,1934,"During filming in high temperatures in Buttercup Valley near Yuma, Arizona, Director John Ford insisted his cast and crew only work in the early mornings and late afternoons to avoid the most intense heat of each day. Under pressure from RKO to speed up filming, Producer Cliff Reid insisted that the midday break be shortened.
